        - Add --order-by option.

        - Add --include-table (-t), --exclude-table (-T), --include-column (-c),
          and --exclude-column (-C) options.

	- By default, sort by first unique key (which will be the primary key if
          it exists). This can still be overridden by --order-by option.

          predefined "select all rows from table" queries.
